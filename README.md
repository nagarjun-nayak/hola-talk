# Real-Time Video Call Translator & Caption Generator

Real-Time Video Call Translator & Caption Generator is a web application that allows users who speak different languages to converse with ease by translating the audio on the fly and speaking the translated audio in the native language of the user as well as provide them with translated captions. It also offers HD video and screen share, and can accommodate up to 100 concurrent users. The application also generates automatic meeting summaries and transcripts, making it easy for participants to review important details from the meeting.

> This is the Winning solution developed at 36-hour National Level hackathon called 'Hackoverflow 1.0' by PHCET, Navi Mumbai.

## Architecture

<img width="1073" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-18 at 11 09 44 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83623339/226187854-03ec9559-1122-42a3-93c7-80614fdae396.png">

## Installation steps

1. - Fork the [repo](https://github.com/swasthikshetty10/hackoverflow)
   - Clone the repo to your local system `git clone https://github.com/swasthikshetty10/hackoverflow.git`
   - Change current directory `cd hackoverflow`
2. Install latest version of [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Generate prisma client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

4. Copy and Rename the .env.example to .env, place it in the root directory and fill the essential vars.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Warning**
> Do not rename the original .env.example, it is used to keep track for env vars list as .env with values is gitignored

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Known Issues

- There is latency of around 5-6 seconds between the original time and the time when translated audio is spoken out. The latency issue can be tackled by following ways:
  - Use native models for faster transcriptions
  - Use paid APIs for quicker translations like Whisper AI, Google translate etc.
  - Develop a learning model to predict the next moves of the speaker, which is a replacement for WebSpeech API's final transcription boolean.
- As the app relies on browser's native Web Speech API for transcribing and tts, few browsers like Brave with known issues for this API and microphone functions tend to fail at running the app successfully.

## Future scope of development

- Use deepAI models to sync video/lip movements & translated audio.
- Resemble the spoken audio(translated) to source audio(speaker) pitch.
